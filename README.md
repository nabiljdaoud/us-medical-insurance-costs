# U.S. Medical Insurance Costs
This is a small project exploring data structures in python. The notebook implements two python classes, one that is simply a data structure and another that wraps the data structure in an object with methods to analyze the data

## Requirements
This project implements python [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) which requires python 3.7+, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and is contained in a [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook.

## Running
The code is self-contained in the us-medical-insurance-cost.ipynb file. To run open the notebook using `jupyter notebook` from the project root directory.

## Feedback
I welcome feedback on use of data structures especially use of dataclasses and methods used for analysis.
